## Overview

## The challenge

I was asked by a client to build a beautiful, user-friendly and responsive website that was a good representation of their brand, and which would allow users to:

- View the optimal layout for the business' offerings online regardless of their device's screen size,
- Experience fun interactions while navigating the website,
- Easily view the business' menu and offerings,
- Easily find and contact the business to mae orders.

## My Process

I designed the website

### The Design

A low-fidelity sketch of the application was drawn followed by a hi-fidelity mockup.

The application was designed to allow the user to easily generate advice at their desk or on the go, with both desktop and mobile versions of the site.

The color palette and fonts were chosen with accessibility in mind, particularly, color blind users.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```
