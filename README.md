## About the Project

### Overview

The Bakery at Fairview website is a project that aims to create a delightful online experience for the bakery customers. As a software engineer, I was tasked with building a beautiful, user-friendly, and responsive website that aligns with brand values and meets specific business goals.

### Goals

The key objectives of this project included:

- Creating a visually appealing website that represents The Bakery at Fairview's brand.
- Ensuring a responsive design for an optimal viewing experience on various devices.
- Implementing engaging user interactions for seamless navigation.
- Displaying the bakery's menu and offerings in an organized and user-friendly manner.
- Providing easy access to contact information for placing orders.

## Technologies Used

This project was built using the following technologies:

- HTML5
- CSS3 with custom properties
- Flexbox and CSS Grid for layout design
- JavaScript for interactivity
- A mobile-first development approach for responsiveness


### What I Learned

During the development of The Bakery at Fairview website, I had the opportunity to learn and apply various web development concepts and techniques. Some key takeaways include:

- Leveraging CSS Grid and Flexbox for effective layout design.
- Implementing responsive design principles for a seamless user experience on different devices.
- Enhancing user interactions with JavaScript for navigation and menu exploration.
- Prioritizing accessibility and usability to cater to a wide range of users, including those with disabilities.


### Continued Development

As part of the ongoing development, there are several areas I plan to focus on:

- Creating the online ordering system to provide a smooth checkout experience.
- Expanding the website's content to include a blog section for sharing bakery-related stories and recipes.
- Implementing SEO best practices to improve online visibility and reach a broader audience.


### The Design

A low-fidelity sketch of the application was drawn followed by a hi-fidelity mockup.

The application was designed to allow the user to easily interact with the bakery at their desk or on the go, with both desktop and mobile versions of the site.

The color palette and fonts were chosen with accessibility in mind, particularly, color blind users.
