## About the Project

### Overview

The Bakery at Fairview website is a project that aims to create a delightful online experience for our bakery customers. As a software engineer, I was tasked with building a beautiful, user-friendly, and responsive website that aligns with our brand values and meets specific business goals.

### Goals

The key objectives of this project included:

- Creating a visually appealing website that represents The Bakery at Fairview's brand.
- Ensuring a responsive design for an optimal viewing experience on various devices.
- Implementing engaging user interactions for seamless navigation.
- Displaying our bakery's menu and offerings in an organized and user-friendly manner.
- Providing easy access to contact information for placing orders.

## Technologies Used

This project was built using the following technologies:

- HTML5
- CSS3 with custom properties
- Flexbox and CSS Grid for layout design
- JavaScript for interactivity
- A mobile-first development approach for responsiveness


### The Design

A low-fidelity sketch of the application was drawn followed by a hi-fidelity mockup.

The application was designed to allow the user to easily generate advice at their desk or on the go, with both desktop and mobile versions of the site.

The color palette and fonts were chosen with accessibility in mind, particularly, color blind users.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```
